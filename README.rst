pyiron - an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science. It combines several tools in a common platform:

 - Atomic structure objects – compatible to the `Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_.
 - Atomistic simulation codes – like `LAMMPS <http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_ and `VASP <https://www.vasp.at>`_.
 - Feedback Loops – to construct dynamic simulation life cycles.
 - Hierarchical data management – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.
 - Integrated visualization – based on `NGLview <https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_.
 - Interactive simulation protocols - based on `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_.
 - Object oriented job management – for scaling complex simulation protocols from single jobs to high-throughput simulations.

pyiron (called pyron) is developed in the `Computational Materials Design department <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_ of `Joerg Neugebauer <https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386>`_ at the `Max Planck Institut für Eisenforschung (Max Planck Institute for iron research) <https://www.mpie.de/2281/en>`_. While its original focus was to provide a framework to develop and run complex simulation protocols as needed for ab initio thermodynamics it quickly evolved into a versatile tool to manage a wide variety of simulation tasks. In 2016 the `Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS) <http://www.icams.de>`_ joined the development of the framework with a specific focus on high throughput applications. In 2018 pyiron was released as open-source project.
See the `Documentation <http://pyiron.org>`_ page for more details.


Installation
------------
You can test pyiron on `Mybinder.org (beta) <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyiron/pyiron/master?urlpath=lab>`_.
For a local installation we recommend to install pyiron inside an `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_  environment::

    conda install -c conda-forge pyiron


After the installation of pyiron you need to configure pyiron. The default configuration can be generated automatically. Start a new Python session and import pyiron::

   > import pyiron
   > pyiron.install()
   >>> It appears that pyiron is not yet configured, do you want to create a default start configuration (recommended: yes). [yes/no]:
   > yes
   > exit()


See the `Documentation-Installation <https://pyiron.github.io/source/installation.html>`_ page for more details.


Example
-------
After the successful configuration you can start your first pyiron calculation. Navigate to the the projects directory and start a jupyter notebook or jupyter lab session correspondingly::

    cd ~/pyiron/projects
    jupyter notebook

Open a new jupyter notebook and inside the notebook you can now validate your pyiron calculation by creating a test project, setting up an initial structure of bcc Fe and visualize it using NGLview::

    from pyiron import Project
    pr = Project('test')
    structure = pr.create_structure('Fe', 'bcc', 2.78)
    structure.plot3d()

Finally a first lammps calculation can be executed by::

    job = pr.create_job(job_type=pr.job_type.Lammps, job_name='lammpstestjob')
    job.structure = structure
    job.potential = job.list_potentials()[0]
    job.run()


Getting started:
----------------
For users - test pyiron with mybinder:
