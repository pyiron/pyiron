pyiron - an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science. It combines several tools in a common platform:

• Atomic structure objects – compatible to the `Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_.

• Atomistic simulation codes – like `LAMMPS <http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_ and `VASP <https://www.vasp.at>`_.

• Feedback Loops – to construct dynamic simulation life cycles.

• Hierarchical data management – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.

• Integrated visualization – based on `NGLview <https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_.

• Interactive simulation protocols - based on `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_.

• Object oriented job management – for scaling complex simulation protocols from single jobs to high-throughput simulations.

pyiron (called pyron) is developed in the `Computational Materials Design department <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_ of `Joerg Neugebauer <https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386>`_ at the `Max Planck Institut für Eisenforschung (Max Planck Institute for iron research) <https://www.mpie.de/2281/en>`_. While its original focus was to provide a framework to develop and run complex simulation protocols as needed for ab initio thermodynamics it quickly evolved into a versatile tool to manage a wide variety of simulation tasks. In 2016 the `Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS) <http://www.icams.de>`_ joined the development of the framework with a specific focus on high throughput applications. In 2018 pyiron was released as open-source project.

.. note::

    **pyiron 0.X – Disclaimer**: With the first open source release of pyiron under the `BSD license <https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ we provide a fully functional core platform. We are currently working on finalizing various plugins, e.g. to enhance high throughput simulations, for `Computational Phase Studies <https://www.mpie.de/2891195/computational_phase_studies>`_, and `Electrochemistry and Corrosion <https://www.mpie.de/3119070/Corrosion>`_. The code is published on `Github.org <https://github.com/pyiron>`_, `PyPi.org <https://pypi.org/user/pyiron/>`_ and `Anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/pyiron>`_

**************
Explore pyiron
**************
We provide various options to install, explore and run pyiron:

* :ref:`Workstation Installation (recommeded) <InstallLocal>`: for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X workstations (interface for local VASP executable, support for the latest jupyterlab based GUI)

* :ref:`Mybinder.org (beta) <InstallBinder>`: test pyiron directly in your browser (no VASP license, no visualization, only temporary data storage)

* :ref:`Docker (for demonstration) <InstallDocker>`: requires Docker installation (no VASP license, only temporary data storage)

Please contact us if you are interested in using pyiron:

* to interface your simulation code or method

* implementing high-throughput approaches based on atomistic codes

* to learn more about method development and Big Data in material science.
