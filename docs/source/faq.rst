How to cite pyiron?
===================
To cite pyiron and the corresponding codes, please follow the instructions on the `publication page <citation.html>`_.

What units does pyiron use?
===========================
* mass = atomic mass units
* distance = Angstroms
* time = femtoseconds
* energy = eV
* velocity = Angstroms/femtoseconds
* force = eV/Angstrom
* temperature = Kelvin
* pressure = GPa
* charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)

How to import existing calculation?
===================================
Importing existing calculations is currently only supported for VASP. A tutorial how to import existing calculations is available in the tutorial section. 

How to import structures from files or existing databases?
==========================================================
To read structure formats you can use ASE and then convert the structure to a pyiron structure using:

.. code-block::

  from pyiron import ase_to_pyiron
  pyiron_structure = ase_to_pyiron(ase_structure) 
 

How to install pyiron?
======================
pyiron is designed to be installed as centralized service on your local computer cluster, rather than a local installation
on each individual workstation. To test pyiron online or with a local installation, please follow the instructions on the
`installation page <installation.html>`_.

How do I install additional codes for pyiron? 
=============================================
When installing pyiron via conda it is possible to install most opensource codes via conda as well:

How to use a custom Pseudo potential in VASP?
=============================================
There are two ways to assign custom potentials in VASP, either you can change the pseudo potential for all atoms of one species: 

.. code-block::

  job_vasp.potential.Fe = "~/resources/vasp/potentials/potpaw_PBE/Fe/POTCAR"

Or alternatively you can change the pseudo potential of a single atom by creating a new element: 

.. code-block::

  my_fe = pr.create_element(
      new_element_name="Fe", 
      parent_element="Fe", 
      potential_file="~/resources/vasp/potentials/potpaw_PBE/Fe/POTCAR"
  ) 
  job_vasp.structure[0] = my_fe


How to use VASP tags which are not supported by pyiron?
=======================================================
The underlying input of any simulation code in pyiron can be directly accessed. For VASP you can change the INCAR parameters using the VASP specific syntax: 

.. code-block::

  job_vasp.input.incar["ENCUT"] = 320.0  # eV 


How to use a custom potential in LAMMPS?
========================================
A custom empirical potential (here, a hybrid potential) can be defined in the following format:

.. code-block::

  custom_potential = pd.DataFrame({    
    'Name': ['SrTiO3_Pedone'],
    'Filename': [[]],
    'Model': ['Custom'],
    'Species': [['O', 'Sr', 'Ti']],
    'Config': [['atom_style full\n',  # I use 'full' here as atom_style 'charge' gives the same result
                '## create groups ###\n', 
                'group O type 1\n', 
                'group Sr type 2\n', 
                'group Ti type 3\n', 
                '\n', 
                '## set charges - beside manually ###\n', 
                'set group O charge -1.2000\n',  
                'set group Sr charge 1.2000\n',
                'set group Ti charge 2.4000\n',
                '\n', 
                'pair_style hybrid/overlay morse 15.0 mie/cut 15.0 coul/long 15.0 beck 15.0\n', 
                'pair_coeff * * coul/long\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 2 beck 3.0 0 0 0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 3 beck 1.0 0 0 0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 1 beck 22.0 0 0 0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 2 mie/cut 3.0 1.0 12.0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 3 mie/cut 1.0 1.0 12.0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 1 mie/cut 22.0 1.0 12.0 0\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 2 morse 0.019623 1.8860 3.32833\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 3 morse 0.024235 2.2547 2.708943\n', 
                'pair_coeff 1 1 morse 0.042395 1.3793 3.618701\n', 
                'kspace_style ewald 1.0e-8\n']]
  })
  
The lines in ``Config`` will be written to the LAMMPS ``potential.inp`` file. Make sure that the arrangement of the species in ``Species`` is the same as the group types ``create groups`` within ``Config``. Otherwise, a mixup or the species may occur in the LAMMPS ``structure.inp`` file.

The potential can then be used by assigning ``job.potential = custom_potential``.

How to extend the potential database inside pyiron?
===================================================
By default pyiron provides access to the OpenKIM and NIST databases for interatomic potentials and individual potentials can be added as discussed above. While there was an option to extend the default database this option was disabled as it decreased the reproducibility of simulation protocols. 

How to link your own executable?
================================
The linking of executables is explained as part of the installation in the section of advanced configuarion options. By default pyiron links to the executables provided by conda but you can accelerate you calculation by compiling your own version of a given simulation code which is optimized for your hardware. 

How to send a calculation to the background ?
=============================================
While most examples execute calculations inline or in modal mode, it is also possible to send calculation in the background. 

.. code-block::

  job.server.run_mode.non_modal = True
  job.run()
  print("execute other commands while the job is running.")
  pr.wait_for_job(job)
  
In this example the job is executed in the background, while the print command is already executed. Afterwards the project object waits for the execution of the job in the background to be finished. 

How to submit a calculation to the queuing system?
==================================================
Just like executing calculation in the background it is also possible to submit calculation to the queuing system: 

.. code-block::

  job.server.list_queues()  # returns a list of queues available on the system
  job.server.view_queues()  # returns a DataFrame listing queues and their settings 
  job.server.queue = "my_queue"  # select a queue 
  job.server.cores = 80          # set the number of cores 
  job.server.run_time = 3600     # set the run time in seconds
  job.run()

For the queuing system to be available in pyiron it is necessary to configure it. The configuration of different queuing systems is explained in the installation. 

How to setup spin constraint calculation?
=========================================
pyiron supports setting up spin constrained calculations for VASP using the generic spin_constraint property: 

.. code-block::

  job_vasp.spin_constraints = 1

What is the meaning of the name - pyiron?
=========================================
pyiron is the combination of **py** + **iron** connecting Python, the programming language with iron as pyiron was
initially developed at the Max Planck Institut f√ºr Eisenforschung (iron research).

Which output quantities are stored in pyiron?
