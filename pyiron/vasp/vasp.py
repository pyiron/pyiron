class Vasp(VaspInteractive):
    """
    Class to setup and run and analyze VASP simulations which is a derivative of pyiron.objects.job.generic.GenericJob.
    The functions in these modules are written in such the function names and attributes are very generic
    (get_structure(), molecular_dynamics(), version) but the functions are written to handle VASP specific input/output.

    Args:
        project (pyiron.project.Project instance):  Specifies the project path among other attributes
        job_name (str): Name of the job

    Examples:
        Let's say you need to run a vasp simulation where you would like to control the input parameters manually. To
        set up a static dft run with Gaussian smearing and a k-point MP mesh of [6, 6, 6]. You would have to set it up
        as shown below:

        >>> ham = Vasp(job_name="trial_job")
        >>> ham.input.incar[IBRION] = -1
        >>> ham.input.incar[ISMEAR] = 0
        >>> ham.input.kpoints.set(size_of_mesh=[6, 6, 6])

        However, the according to pyiron's philosophy, it is recommended to avoid using code specific tags like IBRION,
        ISMEAR etc. Therefore the recommended way to set this calculation is as follows:

        >>> ham = Vasp(job_name="trial_job")
        >>> ham.calc_static()
        >>> ham.set_occupancy_smearing(smearing="gaussian")
        >>> ham.set_kpoints(mesh=[6, 6, 6])
        The exact same tags as in the first examples are set automatically.
