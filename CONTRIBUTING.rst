pyiron developer meetings
-------------------------
If you are interested in discussing pyiron's development, we encourage you to virtually
participate in the pyiron developer meeting Mondays at 15:00 german time (GMT+2).
Contact us if you want to participate in the weekly virtual pyiron developer meeting, become part of the pyiron organization, and check the discussion page for details.

How can I contribute?
=====================

Reporting bugs
--------------

    Note: If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same
    thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a
    link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**

Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of pyiron.
Check the `FAQ page`_ for a list of common questions and problems.
Briefly search the issues page for `bugs`_  to see if the problem has already
been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment
to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. You can create an issue on
the pyiron repository by including the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps you took so we can reproduce the problem as closely as possible.
* Provide sample code that causes the problem. Include code snippets as markdown code blocks.
* Include information about the environment (OS, python version, how packages were installed) in which you were running pyiron.
* Explain what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.

Suggesting Enhancements
-----------------------

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. You can create an issue on
the pyiron repository by including the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Describe the exact behavior you would expect the suggested feature to produce.
* Provide sample code that you would use to access the feature. If possible, include code for how you think the feature could be built into pyiron's codebase. Include code snippets as markdown code blocks.

Your first code contribution
----------------------------

Unsure where to begin contributing to pyiron? You can start by looking
through these good-first-issue and help-wanted issues:

* `Good first issues`_ - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* `Help wanted issues`_ - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

**Local development**

pyiron can be developed and tested locally. If you are using pyiron to run an
external software package, e.g. VASP or LAMMPS, you might also need to install
those packages locally to run certain integration tests in pyiron.

To get the developmental (git) version of pyiron,

.. code-block::

  git clone https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron.git
  conda env update --name pyiron_dev --file pyiron/.ci_support/environment.yml
  conda activate pyiron_dev
  conda install conda-build
  conda develop pyiron
  
**Deploy development version to a managed environment**

If you want to use a development version of pyiron in a managed environment where a version of pyiron is
already installed outside of your control (e.g. on the cmti/cmfe cluster), you can still preload a local
checkout of the repo, while using the dependencies already installed.  Assuming pyiron and dependencies
are already installed and setup, clone the repository to a location of your choice

.. code-block::
  
  mkdir -p ~/software
  cd ~/software
  git clone https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron.git
  
add this folder to your python path by adding this line to your `~/.profile`

.. code-block::

  export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/software/pyiron:$PYTHONPATH"
  
and finally restart any jupyter or jupyterhub session you might still have running.  Within this folder
you can then check out any local branchen, push your own dev branches, etc and python will automatically
use this version over the system-wide installation.  Check that it works by running the following cell

.. code-block::

  import pyiron
  print(pyiron.__file__)
  
If it doesn't print the path of your checkout, check that you restarted all the relevant shell sessions
and that the environment variables are correctly updated.

**Local Testing**

The full test suite is always run automatically when you open a new pull request.  Still it 
sometimes nice to run all or only specific tests on your machine.  To do that run from the repo root, e.g.

.. code-block::

  python -m unittest discover tests
  python -m unittest discover tests/sphinx
  python -m unittest tests/sphinx/test_base.py

Where the first line runs all tests, the second all the sphinx tests and the final line only the tests in that file.
Keep in mind that to run the tests your repository needs to be inside your pyiron project folder and you need to have 
at least the basic resources installed from `tests/static`.  A neat trick when testing/debugging is to combine the 
pdb and unittest modules like this

.. code-block::

  python -m pdb -m unittest ...
  
This allows you to re-use the sometimes complicated setups for your interactive debugging that might be otherwise
difficult to replicate in a REPL.

Pull requests
-------------

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain pyiron's quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible tools
* Enable a sustainable system for pyiron's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

* Keep the changes in your pull request as focused as possible - only address one issue per pull request wherever possible.
* Follow the `Styleguides`_
* Assign the appropriate label (see `Issue and pull request labels`_) to your pull request. If you are fixing a specific Github issue, reference the issue directly in the pull request comments.
* If you are aware which maintainer is most closely related to the code you've edited, feel free to request their review.
* After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing.
* If a status check fails and it seems to be unrelated to your changes, explain why the failure is unrelated as a comment in your pull request.
* If you add a new external dependency, please check it is up to date. Packages which have not been updated for five years are considered outdated.
* If you rename an existing python module, please open a separate pull request to simplify the review process. 

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your
pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete
additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull
request can be ultimately accepted.

Styleguides
===========

Git commit messages
-------------------

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:

\:art: (``:art:``) improves the format/structure of the code

\:zap: (``:zap:``) improves performance

\:memo: (``:memo:``) adds documentation

\:bug: (``:bug:``) fixes a bug

\:fire: (``:fire:``) removes code or files

\:green_heart: (``:green_heart:``) fixes the CI build

\:white_check_mark: (``:white_check_mark:``) adds tests

Managing git commits is much easier using an IDE (we recommend PyCharm).

Python styleguide
-----------------

Please follow `PEP8 conventions`_ for all python code added to pyiron. Pull
requests will be checked for PEP8 plus a few other security issues with
`Codacy`_, and will be rejected if they do not meet the specified
formatting criteria. Further, new contributions will be formatted according to the `black formatting`_ rules.

Positional and keyword arguments should be separated by an `*,` argument, which is python syntactic sugar which will prevent downstream users from abusing keyword arguments as positional arguments.

Any new features should include coverage with a unit test, such that
your pull request does not decrease pyiron's overall coverage. This
will be automatically tested within the ci test suite and `Coveralls`_.

Deprecation warning template
----------------------------
*XXX is deprecated as of vers. A.B.C. It is not guaranteed to be in service in vers. D.E.F. Use YYY instead.*

Documentation styleguide
------------------------

All new/modified functions should include a docstring that follows
the `Google Python Docstring format`_.

Documentation is built automatically with `Sphinx`_; any manually created
documentation should be added as a restructured text (.rst) file
under pyiron/docs/source.

Notebooks created to exemplify features in pyiron are very useful, and
can even be used as integration tests. If you have added a major feature,
consider creating a notebook to show its usage under pyiron/notebooks/.
See the other examples that are already there.

Additional notes
================

Issue and pull request labels
-----------------------------

We use the following tags to organize pyiron Github issues
and pull requests:

* bug: something isn't working
* duplicate: this issue/pull request already existed
* enhancement: new feature or request
* good first issue: easy fix for beginners
* help wanted: extra attention is needed
* invalid: this doesn't seem right
* question: further information is requested
* wontfix: this will not be worked on
* stale: inactive after 2 weeks

pyiron release distribution
---------------------------

.. image:: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyiron/badges/downloads.svg
    :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyiron/
    :alt: Downloads

Pyiron is released through `conda-forge`_ and  `pip`_. 
Both packages are created automatically and maintained with every new release of pyiron. In order to use these distributions simply use the following command for conda::
   conda install -c conda-forge pyiron
In order to use the pip distribution use::
   pip install pyiron
Just like each other commit to the master branch the tagged releases are pushed to pypi.org (https://pypi.org/project/pyiron/#history)::
The major difference for pypi (pip) is that installing pre-release versions is possible using the `--pre` flag::
   pip install --pre pyiron
Those pre-release versions are named `<version_number>.post0.dev<release number>` ::
   0.2.0.post0.dev1
For pip both the pre-releases as well as the official releases are available. For conda only the official releases are available.

Versioning
----------

Pyiron projects use "semantic versioning". The `basic concept`_ is:

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
    2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
    3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

This is fairly straightforward, but there is a little bit of interpretation needed here for what is "incompatible" and what is "backward compatible". In particular, for the edge-case of re-ordering keyword arguments -- which _could_ break backwards compatibility if a downstream user was using kwargs positionally -- we have decided to treat this as a minor update. Under such circumstances, please also take the opportunity to add a `*` argument between the last positional arg and the first kwarg, as this will prevent users form (ab)using kwargs as positional arguments going forwards.

Building process for a release
---------------------------------
Check if all tests as explained in the next chapter have passed
1. Create a Git tag to mark the release
This step is done manually and important to trigger all the following steps. Tag can be created under https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/tags. 
The following steps are automated and will be performed once a tag is created. 
In order to keep the tags consistent please follow the `Git-Tag-Guide`_.
The tag format consists of a tag_prefix (<package name>-) and the release version, for example::
     pyiron-0.2.0
2. Automatically create PyPi package
  After the tag is created, the `Deploy-Workflow`_ is triggered, which creates the PyPi Package.
  The configuration of the release is included in the `setup.ctg file`_.
  This Workflow first installs all dependencies, then allows for future versions of the dependencies and builds the package. After that the package is published to `pip`_.
3. Automatically create conda-forge package
  This release than is recognized by a conda-forge bot, which triggers a new pull request for the conda-forge package and merges automatically if all tests pass.
4. Docker images
  The docker images are maintained manually and therefore not updated with every release. The docker images are build using the conda packages and can be found in different variants under https://github.com/pyiron/docker-stacks
5. Graphical installer
  The graphical installer is also maintained manually and not updated as frequently and can be found at https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron-installer.

GitHub Workflows
-----------------------------
The `GitHub-Action-Workflows`_ are triggered at different occasions (eg. creating commit, push to master):

* UpdateDependabotPR.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/blob/main/.github/workflows/UpdateDependabotPR.yml

* codeql-analysis.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml

* deploy.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

* docs.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml

* notebooks.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/main/.github/workflows/notebooks.yml

* pypicheck.yml: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/main/.github/workflows/pypicheck.yml

**UpdateDependabotPR**

This workflow is used to keep the dependencies of the setup.py and of the environment.yml synchronized.
Therefore, it retrieves the head of the branch and runs the ./.ci_support/update_environment.py script to apply the automated changes to the setup.py (by `dependabot`_) also to the environment.yml.
The script basically checks the title of the PR and bumps the version number from a package to a new version number.
After that, the version is written into the environment.yml file located at ./.ci_support/environment.yml.
If this is done successfully, the workflow saves the changes and pushes back to the branch of the PR.

**codeql-analysis.yml**

This workflow is used to find vulnerablities inside the codebase with CodeQL.
First, the head of the branch is retvieved and CodeQL is initialized.
After that, the CodeQL analysis is performed and the results are returned.

**deploy.yml**

This workflow is used to upload and deploy a new release to PyPi. 
First, the install dependencies in order to create the PyPi distribution.
After that, the version restriction of the dependencies are lifted to allow for future versions and the PyPi package is build according to the setup.py
This release is then uploaded to PyPi, but only if it is tagged correctly.

**docs.yml**

This workflow is used to test, if the documentation can build.
First, the environment is setup and a conda environment is created based on ./.ci_support/environment-docs.yml.
After that, the documentation folder is created and the documentation is build with sphinx.

**notebooks.yml**

This workflow is used to test, if the code is compatible with jupyter notebooks found in in the `notebooks folder`_.
First, the environment is setup and a conda environment is created based on ./.ci_support/environment-notebooks.yml.
After that, the script ./.ci_support/build_notebooks.sh is executed, which tests if the notebooks can be executed.

**pypicheck.yml**

This workflow is used to test, if the installation of the pypi package works.
First, the environment is setup and the installation is run.
After that, pip check is run, to verify if the packages installed based on the environment.yml have compatible dependencies.


Debugging
================
My job does not run on the queue
-----------------------------

In case a job runs properly while executing it locally (or on the head node), but not when you submit it to a queue,

**1. Check if the job class is available in the project:**

In this example, we want a custom job class `ProtoMD` from the module `pyiron_contrib`:

.. code-block::

  from pyiron import Project
  import pyiron_contrib  # only if importing a custom job class

  pr = Project("debug")
  dir(pr.job_type)

This should output:

.. code-block::

  >>> ['AtomisticExampleJob',
   'Atoms',
   'ConvEncutParallel',
   ...
   ...
   'ProtoMD']

If you see your job class in the list, proceed to step 3. If not, 


**2. Check if the job class is initialized in `__init__.py` of the module**

Make sure that the `__init__.py` of your module (here, `pyiron_contrib`) initializes the job class in the following format:

.. code-block::

  from pyiron import Project
  from pyiron_base.job.jobtype import JOB_CLASS_DICT

  # Make classes available for new pyiron version
  JOB_CLASS_DICT["ProtoMD"] = "pyiron_contrib.protocol.compound.md"  # the path of your job class
  
  
**3. Confirm that the job class can be instantiatied**

Create a new job, but instead of running it, save it:

.. code-block::

  job = pr.create.job.ProtoMD("job")
  ...  # input parameters that the job requires
  ...
  job.save()

  >>> 98  # this is the job id of the saved job

Note down the job id, then run the following line:

.. code-block::

  job["TYPE"]

This should output an instance of the job class:

.. code-block::

  >>> "<class 'pyiron_contrib.protocol.compound.md.ProtoMD'>"

Now we know that the job class is indeed available in the project and can be instantiated.

**4. Debug using a second notebook**

Submitting and running a job on the queue, is essentially the same as saving a job in one notebook, but loading and executing it in another notebook.

In **a new notebook** , load the job that you just saved, using its job id. You may or may not import the module (here, `pyiron_contrib`):

.. code-block::

  from pyiron import Project
  # we do not import pyiron_contrib here, becasue it should not be necessary

  pr = Project("second_notebook")
  reloaded_job = pr.load(98)  # 98 is the job id of the previously saved job
  reloaded_job.run(run_again=True)

If the job loads and runs properly, the job should also run properly on the queue. This also means that there may be a bug in your custom job class. Debug the job class, and repeat steps 3 and 4 till you no longer get an error in step 4.
